# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on past stock data and used to forecast future prices, making it a valuable tool for financial analysis and decision-making.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the closing prices of a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc.) using an LSTM model. The model is built using historical stock data and tested on recent data to evaluate its accuracy. The project includes data processing, model training, and prediction steps.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure you have historical stock data in the appropriate format.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the provided script or Jupyter notebook to train the LSTM model.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices based on the latest available data.

Example command to run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Model Description

The LSTM model is designed to handle time series data, making it ideal for stock price prediction. The model uses 60 days of historical data to predict the closing price of the stock on the next day.

Key steps in the model:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling and shaping the data for input into the LSTM model.
- **Model Architecture**: The LSTM network consists of three LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer that outputs the predicted price.
- **Training**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

## Results

The model's predictions are compared with actual stock prices to evaluate performance. Results can be visualized using graphs to show the accuracy of the model over time.
